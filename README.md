App2.Java is the main file. It contains a password prompt that will not allow the other features to run until the password is guessed correctly. (The password is "password123")
Correctly guessing the password allows you to either end the program or choose a "mini-game" (method) to run.
Every other feature of App2.Java comes from a method referenced in the program.
